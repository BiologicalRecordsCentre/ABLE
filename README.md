This is a tool to keep track of the IT elements of  the project.

## Issue

Add an issue for a small peice of work. Examples might be 'Load in updated transect data', 'Calculate grassland indicator' etc. Issues can be 'tagged' in a number of ways. Issues should be SMART (specific, measureable, achievable, relevant and time-bound), and should be closed when complete.

- Issues should be assigned to someone. This is the person that takes responsibility for the task and is often the person who created the issue
- Issues should be tagged with labels. These are keywords that allow issues to be filtered. This would usually include keywords as appropriate e.g. 'Indicators', 'Guidance', 'Tool', are all tags. You can create new tags but make sure there is not already one you can use
- Issues can be assigned to 'projects'. A 'project' is a defined peice of work that is generally self-contained.

To create an issue you 'Open' a new issue, give it a short title and then a longer description. You will then assign it to someone, label it and link it to a project.

If you want to call someone's attention you can type their username with the `@` symbol (e.g. @DavidRoy). When you do this they will get an email telling them they have been mentioned

You can create check lists in your description using this notation: 

`- [ ] Task to be done`

`- [x] Task that has been done`

`- [ ] Another task to be done`

Which will produce this:

- [ ] Task to be done
- [x] Task that has been done
- [ ] Another task to be done

## Projects

Projects are peices of work that generally result in defined end-point (e.g. output produced). Projects have their own pages with a description of what they are and panels showing issues that are assigned to them. Projects should be created by people responsible for them and in almost all cases issues will be assigned to a project.

## Milestones

Milestones are time limited collections of issues. A milestone says 'These issues need to complete by this date' and provides a nice way to see you progress towards your goal. Milestones are useful for hard deadlines, they can also span projects.
